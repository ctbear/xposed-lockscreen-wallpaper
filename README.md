### Xposed Lockscreen Wallpaper ###

This is an Xposed module that allows setting a different background than that on the homescreen.

The following modes are supported:

- Default (same as homescreen)

- Solid color

- Custom image

- "See through" - a blurred, frosted glass effect that "peeks though" the lockscreen
